# STEP-BY-STEP PLAN TO OWN PFI 100% SAFETY

**Step 1: Limited supply growth**  \
The main benefit for investors & stakers comes from limited supply growth. The TingFi protocol the majority of which are distributed to the stakers. Thus, the gain for stakers will come from their auto compounding balances, though price exposure remains an important consideration. That is stakers would make a profit although inflation. &#x20;

**Step 2: High APY (1000% earn)** \
The community wins by receiving fixed high APY that never fluctuates, and seed-stage access to the most promising projects in the world - projects that they could rarely (if ever) gain access to - the community must approve of the investment for it to eventuate by voting on-chain so the community is invested in the project from the start.

**Step 3: TingFi Layer 2 Protocol Powerful - multi-staking & social staking, especially NFT.**  \
At a high level, TingFi consists of its protocol managed treasury, protocol owned liquidity, and high staking rewards that are designed to control supply expansion. With the LP bond, the protocol is able to accumulate liquidity to ensure the system stability. The TingFi protocol manage to maintain the high staking APY.&#x20;

**Step 4: Burn : a mechanism of token destroying in order to pump its price.**

**Step5: An epoch lasts 6 hours for the TingFi protocol.**\
According to Bison Trails, an epoch is an era of time within a blockchain network.This era of time is used to define when certain actions will take place within a blockchain network, such as when rewards will be paid out or when a new group of validators will be put in charge of verifying transactions. That era of time is defined differently on every blockchain protocol. It is usually defined as the period of time it takes for a specific number of blocks to be finalized on the chain. Epoch : A definite duration that is set depending of each protocol. Locking the TFI protocol for a duration of 6 epoch helps reducing the volatility and dumps on the TFI. Indeed, the price of TFI is an important element to maintain good on the pools.

**Step 6: TingFi value in the future by engaged community**\
The projects that TingFi invests in win by instantly gaining a ready-made, large, and engaged community that is invested in our project from day one. \
TingFi is 100% owned by its community of NFT holders and TFI token holders who vote on all significant matters affecting TingFi direction â€“ the community always comes first, now and forever!\
TingFi was built for the people, not for an individual or company.
