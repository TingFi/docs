# WHY LOWEST TRADING FEE IS A CORE STRATEGY?

At TingFi, the fee for depositing and withdrawing liquidity is 0% because we are confident TingFi is attractive enough to keep liquidity providers with us.

* Swap fee: When you make a token swap, you will pay a lowest trading fee. This fee is considered "the best" when compared to other DEFI projects.
* Gas fee: The TingFi Protocol works on the Binance Smart Chain (BEP-20), so every interaction with the protocol TingFi is executed in the form of an on-chain transation, and is thus subje4 to gas fee applicable to all transactions on the underlying Binance Smart Chain. Two essential implicit costs native to AMM-based TingFi are slippage for exchange users and divergence loss for LPs.
* Slippage
* Impermanent loss
