# Why need Defi 2.0

* UDEFI - 1st NFT DEFI 2.0 platform is for anyone that wants to generate passive income daily, next generation NFTFi on the leading NFT liquidity protocol.&#x20;
* UDEFI is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) - the community owns and controls UDEFI. The community controls UDEFI's direction.
* UDEFI operates via smart contracts living on the blockchain that have been permanently locked. This allows anyone to audit UDEFI's open-source code whilst making it impossible for anyone to change it.
* The smart contract operates autonomously which means it is self-executing, running independently, without any human intervention, performing only the tasks that it was programmed to perform.
