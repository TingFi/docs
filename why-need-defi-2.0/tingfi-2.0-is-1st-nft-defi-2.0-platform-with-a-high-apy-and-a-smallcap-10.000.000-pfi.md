# TINGFI 2.0 IS 1ST NFT DEFI 2.0 PLATFORM - WITH A HIGH APY AND A SMALLCAP (10.000.000 PFI)

APY stands for annual percentage yield. It measures the real rate of return on your principal by taking into account the effect of compounding interest. In the case of TingFi, your staked PFI represents your principal, and the compound interest is added periodically on every epoch (6 hours) thanks to the rebase mechanism.&#x20;

The APY is calculated from the reward yield (a.k.a rebase rate) using the following equation: APY=(1+rewardYield)1095&#x20;

It raises to the power of 1095 because a rebase happens 3 times daily. Consider there are 365 days in a year, this would give a rebase frequency of 365 \* 3 = 1095.
