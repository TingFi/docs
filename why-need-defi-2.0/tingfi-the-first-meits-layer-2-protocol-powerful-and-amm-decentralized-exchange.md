# TINGFI - THE FIRST MEITS LAYER 2 PROTOCOL POWERFUL & AMM DECENTRALIZED EXCHANGE

With TingFi Layer 2 Protocol Powerful, users not have to be diluted through large inflation rates which devalue the protocol. Say goodbye to being forced to exit the network you love to cope with a fluctuating market. Your long-term commitment to the success of a protocol can properly be rewarded, you finally become an actual part of the network.&#x20;

This is the core-layer which we can use to soon build multi-staking & social staking. Over the coming months, TingFi will be able to be staked for other flavors of crypto-assets, especially NFT. We are launching a platform which will become the accelerator for onchain adoption, in just a few steps.

It is a Binance chain-based AMM without central failure points or programming flaws. The government does not control it, and users do not face any counterparty risk. TingFi with DeFi 2.0 Automated Market Maker (AMM) and TingFi protocol will launch to create a genuinely sustainable and beneficial model that would ensure the longevity of the TingFi ecosystem that allows for TingFi to adapt and evolve with the DeFi space in general, allowing for high yield opportunities and ensuring that the TingFi ecosystem continues to grow and adapt.&#x20;
